                Hi! I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute, the Data Science Institute of UC San Diego.                 
                My research interests lie in data science and natural language processing.
                I received my PhD from The Ohio State University, advised by Prof. Huan Sun.
              </p>
              <p>
                In summer 2022, I interned at MIT-IBM Lab, working with Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim, Leonid Karlinsky, and Rogerio Feris on the efficient adaptation of LLMs. 
                In summer 2021, I was a research intern at the NLP group in Microsoft Research, Redmond, working with Nebojsa Jojic and Nikolay Malkin, studying coherence boosting and prompting calibration on GPT-3.
                In summer 2020, I was a research intern at the Data Science team in NEC Labs America, working with Bo Zong, exploring commonsense knowledge representation and reasoning.

              <h2>Research Overview</h2>
              <p>
                My research interests lie in the areas of data science and natural language processing. I develop principled methods for <b>aligning foundation models with human needs and proactively assisting humans in solving real-world challenges</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                In particular, I'm interested in discovering novel knowledge from massive data (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09285">KDD</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06444">EACL</a>), making black-box models more transparent and interpretable (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00889">ACL</a>), better control and augmentation of large language models (LLMs), including coherence (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08294">ACL</a>), reasoning (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01293">ACL</a>), efficient adaptation (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02861">ICLR</a>). More recently, I have contributed to building <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/">LLM agents</a>, augmenting them with planning (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14992">EMNLP</a>), tool using (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11554">NeurIPS</a>), and prompt optimization (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16427">ICLR</a>), etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm also interested in the applications of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_models">foundation models</a> in accelerating scientific discovery, such as clinical, biomedical, biology research, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                <a style="color:red"><b>Research Opportunities</b></a>: I consistently seek out highly motivated students, particularly from underrepresented groups, to join me in various research projects both during the school year and throughout the summer. If you are interested in LLM augmentation(reasoning, tool-using, planning, etc), LLM agents, and AI4Science research, kindly email me expressing your interest.

              <p>Tired of manual prompt engineering? PromptAgent offers the first principled framework to formalize the problem of API-based prompt optimization (state, action, reward, etc); also the first to benchmark exploration efficiency and show the transferability of optimized prompts. Targeting for expert-level prompting, there are many exciting directions ahead of PromptAgent!</p>

              <p>LLMs lack internal world models for effective reasoning. Reasoning via Planning (RAP) reformulates LLM reasoning as a planning problem, thus incorporating an external world model and principled planning seamlessly. This is a new framework applicable across varying tasks and an exciting direction for LLM augmentation research.</p>
